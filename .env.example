# GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
# Add multiple PATs separated by commas for round-robin usage to handle API rate limits
# IMPORTANT: Each PAT MUST have the following scopes:
#   - repo (Full control of private repositories)
#   - admin:org (Full control of orgs and teams - REQUIRED for runner data)
#   - admin:enterprise (Read enterprise profile data)
#
# How to create a PAT:
# 1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
# 2. Click "Generate new token" > "Generate new token (classic)"
# 3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Enterprise Inventory Tool")
# 4. Select the scopes listed above
# 5. Click "Generate token" and copy it immediately (you won't see it again)
# 6. Add it below, separated by commas if using multiple tokens
GITHUB_PATS=ghp_token1,ghp_token2,ghp_token3
